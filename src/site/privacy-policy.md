## SemBeacon Android App
SemBeacon (Android) is an application owned by Maxim Van de Wynckel for scanning and retrieving information about Bluetooth Low Energy SemBeacons and other related beacons such as iBeacon, AltBeacon or Eddystone.

The application will scan for nearby beacons, which requires the use of the **location** permission. This information is not shared with SemBeacon or other parties and is only used to process the beacon information. This collection is necessary for the functioning of the application whose only functionality is the scanning of beacons.

SemBeacon Android app does not require or allow users to log in therefor offers no possibility for users to remove their own data as no data is collected outside the application. Changes to the privacy policy will be mentioned within app updates or as modification on this website.
