## SemBeacon Android App
SemBeacon (Android) is an application owned by Maxim Van de Wynckel for scanning and retrieving information about Bluetooth Low Energy SemBeacons and other related beacons such as iBeacon, AltBeacon or Eddystone.

The application will scan for nearby beacons, which requires the use of the **location** permission. This information is not shared with SemBeacon or other parties and is only used to process the beacon information. This collection is necessary for the functioning of the application whose only functionality is the scanning of beacons.

SemBeacon Android app does not require or allow users to log in therefor offers no possibility for users to remove their own data as no data is collected outside the application. Changes to the privacy policy will be mentioned within app updates or as modification on this website.

### Permissions
- **Location (Precise)**: This permission is used both for getting the GPS location in the Beacon Map page as well as
a required permission to scan for beacons as these beacons can be used to determine the location.
- **Nearby Devices**: This permission allows nearby devices to detect your phone. This permission is used for the simulation of beacons.
- **Notifications**: An "ongoing" notification is used when simulating a beacon. This is to ensure that users are aware that the phone is broadcasting a beacon in the background.
