subtitle: About the SemBeacon specification and its maintainers
---

SemBeacon was designed by Ph.D candidate [Maxim Van de Wynckel](https://wise.vub.ac.be/maxim-van-de-wynckel) of the [Web & Information Systems Engineering (WISE) Lab](https://wise.vub.ac.be) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Beat Signer](https://beatsigner.com). SemBeacon is a semantic beacon specification for Bluetooth Low Energy that broadcasts a resource URI containing a full semantic description of the beacon, its location and any other related information.

The specification is built on top of [AltBeacon](https://altbeacon.org) and adds an [Eddystone-URL]() compatible scan response
that includes an URI that describes the beacon.

For full details on the specification, check the [documentation](/docs).
