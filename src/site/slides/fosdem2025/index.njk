        To give you a brief introduction about myself, I am Maxim Van de Wynckel, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. 
        My research interests include indoor positioning systems, linked data, and interoperability of location data. 
        I am involved in several open source projects, including OpenHPS, POSO, and SemBeacon some of which I will discuss today.

        One of my personal goals with these projects is to create a world were indoor positioning systems and environemnts are as 
        easily accessible as outdoor positioning systems.

    <h2>Current state of geospatial data</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h3>Outdoor data</h3>
            <img src="./images/service-centric.svg" alt="Service-centric geospatial data">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <h3>Indoor data</h3>

        </div>
    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
        The current state of outdoor geospatial data is service-centric. This means that you can easily access the data you need through predefined services.
        For outdoor data, this is straightfoward as the data is well known and in most cases publicly available.
        Some services may provide more detailed information, but regardless on which service you use, you are always able to access some
        form of data pertaining to a location.

        However, when it comes to indoor data, the situation is quite different. While there are services that collect geospatial data of indoor environments,
        they are not yet as complete as their outdoor counterparts. In a way, this makes sense, since indoor environments are more complex and diverse than outdoor environments.
        Users or building owners may not want to share their data with the public, which makes it harder to collect and share indoor geospatial data and to govern
        who publishes this data.

    </div>
    <aside class="notes">
        A similar story can be told about positioning systems. Outdoor positioning systems are well known and widely used. 
        The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a prime example of this. If we are outdoors, we can easily determine our location using this single technology.

        Again, indoors the situation is quite different. There are several technologies that can be used to determine your location indoors,
        but none of them are as widely used or standardised as GPS. This makes it hard for developers to create applications that work indoors as well as outdoors
        and often leads to navigation applications that only work for one particular building, framework or event.

    <h2>Geospatial-centric service discovery</h2>
    <p>
        The future of geospatial services lies in its discovery through the very locations it represents, rather than predefined services.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/geospatial-centric.svg" alt="Geospacial-centric data discovery">
    <aside class="notes">
        My vision is to create a world where geospatial services are discovered through the very locations they represent, 
        rather than using predefined services. Or in other words, decentralised geospatial data discovery.

        This means that when you are in a particular location, you can discover the services that are available in that location.
        Simply said, you could assume that you do a kind of geospatial query on your location and receive a list of services that are available in that location.
    </aside>

<section>
    <h2>Geospatial-centric service discovery ...</h2>
    <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
    <p>
        How to discover services in a location without relying on a discovery service?
    </p>
    <img width="600px" src="./images/find.svg" alt="Find services in a location">
    <aside class="notes">
        There are a couple of problems or challenges associated with this. First of all, we want to discover
        these services without relying on a centralised discovery service. This would completely defeat the purpose of 
        decentralised geospatial data discovery.

        This also entails that whatever method we use to discover this data should be as easy
        as possible for both users and developers.
    </aside>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Geospatial-centric service discovery ...</h2>
    <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
    <p>
        How to interface with the discovered service(s)?
    </p>
    <img width="600px" src="./images/find_interface.svg" alt="Interface with services in a location">
    <aside class="notes">
        The second challenge is that once we discover services that can provide us with indoor data and positioning systems,
        we need to collect that data in a way that again does not require specific implementations for each service that is out there.

    <aside class="notes">
        The first project I briefly wanted to introduce is OpenHPS. OpenHPS is an open source framework for hybrid positioning systems.
        I will not delve into the details, since it was already covered at a previous FOSDEM talk - but in general you should know
        that it is a TypeScript framework to create positioning systems.

        One issue we noticed after its development was that it was hard to share data between different positioning systems
        or different frameworks. This is where POSO comes in.

    <aside class="notes">
        Developers are not always eager to want to work with linked data to store information, especially for realtime applications
        such as positioning systems. This is why we created the @openhps/rdf package. It basically provides a mapping form
        the OpenHPS data model to RDF and back. This allows developers to easily store their data in a linked data format without
        specifically needing to know how linked data works. Furthermore, they can query the data is if they are querying 
        a MongoDB database, which is a lot more familiar to most developers.

    {% endmarkdown %}
    <aside class="notes">
        With the @openhps/rdf package we already had a way to store our data in a linked data format. However, if we talk about personal data
        or data that needs to be governed by a user, we also need a proper way to store this data. This is where the Solid project comes into place.

        For those who are unfamiliar with Solid, it is a project that allows users to store their data in a decentralised way. The data can be binary
        data, but also structured linked data. Users can assign access rights to the data so that only certain applications or users can access it.

        In addition to this, Solid offers specifications that enable applications to listen for changes in data - which is perfect for realtime applications
        such as positioning systems that want to use Solid as a communication broker.
