## ESP32
We provide a library that can be used to create and scan for SemBeacon's with the Arduino-ESP32 library.

## Android
SemBeacon provides an extension on top of the [android-beacon-library](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/) by [AltBeacon](https://github.com/AltBeacon) which adds the ability to scan for SemBeacons and broadcast the data.

While this tool enables you to broadcast and scan for SemBeacons, it does not provide the necesarry tools for extracting semantic data from the public URI.

Two example applications using this library are available based on existing open source apps:

## iOS
*Currently no tools for iOS exist to demonstrate SemBeacon capabilities.*
