The SemBeacon specification version 1.1 is a non-breaking version that adds an additional flag and aligns the specification with the SOSA ontology. An existing flag is renamed to be broader and still covers the meaning of the previous terminology.

- Renamed **flag 0x04** from "Telemetry data" to "Observable data". Telemetry data is a type of observable data. By renaming this to observable data, we align it with the `sosa:ObservableProperty` naming convention used by the SOSA ontology (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAObservableProperty)
- Added **flag 0x05** for indicating that a beacon contains properties. This is useful for IoT devices where the beacon not only provides output, but where this device can be controlled.
- Flag 0x04 and 0x05 now expect certain semantic data to be available. Specifically a `ssn:hasProperty` for either an observable or [actuable](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/#SOSAActuatableProperty) property.
